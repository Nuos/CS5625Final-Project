\section{Overview}
We propose a simple  game based the short play \textit{Act Without Words I}, by Samuel Becket.   
The setting for the game is sandy dessert under on blazing .  In the middle of this dessert  stands a palm tree, and a pile of perfect spheres.  The premise of the game is to launch these spheres off into the distance using the palm tree as an impromptu catapult.  See Figure 1.

\section{Technical Components}
The primary technical component of our game is modeling, specifically, procedurally generating a palm tree. This includes procedurally generation of the meshes for the trunk and fronds of the palm tree. In addition, we would like to explore how to procedurally generate textures for the barks and leaves. Our goal for this modeling portion is that we are able to make a plausible looking tree. Because it is procedurally generated, we have control of all kinds of parameters to make the tree look different.

The minor technical components includes rendering and animation. For rendering, we would like to implement some normal mapping technique (such as relief mapping) for the trunk with the bark texture. Also, we would like to discover the opaque effect of the leaves, which happens when the light placed behind the leave. For animation, we would like to implement some simple physically based animation techniques such as collision detection. In such way, the tree fronds can avoid overlap.

Above is our main goal for this project. However, if we have more time, below is a list of extensions.
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Wind animation for the tree.}
\item{Sand dune modeling.}
\item{Level of detail algorithm.}
\item{Full day scenario such that the sun and the sky change overtime.}
\end{enumerate}
