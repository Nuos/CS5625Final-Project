\section{Overview}
We propose a simple  game based the short play \textit{Act Without Words I}, by Samuel Becket.   
The setting for the game is sandy dessert under on blazing .  In the middle of this dessert scene stands a palm tree, and a pile of perfect spheres.  The premise of the game is to launch these spheres off into the distance using the palm tree as an impromptu catapult.   When the sphere hits the ground, something or nothing happens.

\section{Technical Components}
The main challenge for our game is how we create a real time physical interactive object such as our palm tree. We would like to experiment how the tree skeleton mesh interacts with different kinds of forces. In order to this, we are going to explore a third party physical engine. Other tasks includes how we can build the mesh for the tree model procedurally according to the skeleton mesh.\\

Another challenge is to make the tree look plausible. We would like to explore the hair optimization method described in [1] and use it to simulate the tree leaves and fronds. In this way, we make our tree model more efficient.\\

We also plan to implement other techniques if time allowed. For example, we can implement a normal/relief mapping for the bark on the trunk. We would also want to explore the wind model described in [2] so that we can see how the palm tree interacts with the wind.
