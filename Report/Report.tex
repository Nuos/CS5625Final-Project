\section{Overview}
We propose a simple  game based the short play \textit{Act Without Words I}, by Samuel Becket.   
The setting for the game is sandy dessert under on blazing .  In the middle of this dessert  stands a palm tree, and a pile of perfect spheres.  The premise of the game is to launch these spheres off into the distance using the palm tree as an impromptu catapult.  See Figure 1.

\section{Technical Components}
The primary technical component of our game is the generation, animation, and rendering vegetation, specifically a  palm tree.  We will focus in particular on the procedural generation and accurate physical simulation.  Procedural generation begins with constructing a skeleton.  In the case of the palm tree, the skeleton is particularly simple. This skeleton provides a natural structure for simulating the physics of the tree.  (The hard work of the simulation will be left to a third party physics engine, such as jbullet.)  From the skeleton, we can generate a simple mesh for the tree using bone system methadology.  If time allows, we will implement normal or relief mapping for the bark on the trunk.

It may  be prohibitively slow to simulate the physics of every leaf.  To address this problem we follow the simulation optimization methodology described in [1].  That is,  we will only perform the simulation using a select number of leaves, and then interpolate to get the remaining leaf geometry.  

Finally, we will apply wind to our tree.  Many methods exist to create this effect, ranging from simple height-based vertex transformations, to more physically plausible procedural methods as in [2], to actually solving the full fluid equations.    The second one seems most interesting, but time constraints may force a simpler approach.
